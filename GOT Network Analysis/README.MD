Overview

Analyze the network of characters in Game of Thrones and how it changes over the course of the books.

Description 

Jon Snow, Daenerys Targaryen, or Tyrion Lannister?
Who is the most important character in Game of Thrones? 
Let's see what mathematics can tell us about this!

In this project, I will look at the character co-occurrence network and its evolution over the five books in R.R. Martin's hugely 
popular book series A Song of Ice and Fire (perhaps better known as the TV show Game of Thrones).
I will look at how the importance of the characters changes over the books using different centrality measures.

This project uses a dataset parsed by Andrew J. Beveridge and Jie Shan.

If you haven't heard of Game of Thrones, then you must be really good at hiding. Game of Thrones is the hugely popular television series by HBO based on the (also) hugely popular book series A Song of Ice and Fire by George R.R. Martin. 
In this project, I will analyze the co-occurrence network of the characters in the Game of Thrones books. Here, two characters are considered to co-occur if their names appear in the vicinity of 15 words from one another in the books.

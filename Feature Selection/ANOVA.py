"""
If the features are categorical, calculate a chi-square (Ï‡2) statistic between each feature and the target vector.
However, if the features are quantitative, compute the ANOVA F-value between each feature and the target vector.

The F-value scores examine if, when we group the numerical feature by the target vector, the means for each group are significantly different

You are working as a car salesman and you would like to develop a model to predict the total dollar amount that customers are willing to pay given the following attributes:
Customer Name
Customer e-mail
Country
Gender
Age
Annual Salary 
Credit Card Debt 
Net Worth 

The model should predict:

Regression works by predicting value of one variable Y based on another variable X.
X is called the independent variable and Y is called the dependant variable.

Goal is to obtain a relationship (model) between the Annual salary and car purchasing amount.
